# Worker Empire
Experimental game with dynamic item system which lets you create completely unique items, mix and combine type specific interactions such as creating an armor that is also a consumable etc.
Discontinued due lack of game assets and serialization of polymorphic data types in unity which required us to use json for data and led us to developing really messy custom unity editor windows and game systems. 
The project as it is today features; Custom unity editor windows that automatically creates the fields of the object with c# reflection, Json file save/load system, A* pathfinding, Expandable inventory system.

# Gameplay goals
The idea was to create a game where the player hires and places the workers to collects materials for the player and with the materials you could craft, sell, upgrade and use the items to explore new cities, improve your influence over the world and expand your "worker empire".
